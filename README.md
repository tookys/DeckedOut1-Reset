This is DeckedOut1:Reset a updated version of TangoTeks original decked out map.

With Deckedout2 running on the season 9 hermit craft server I figured now was a good time to update the old map and update a few features.

This map was originally shared by onemanonechance on reddit but hasnt been updated in 2 years, I opted to update it from 1.16 to 1.19 and to do a few fixes and upgrades to make it a bit more usable for friends on servers.
