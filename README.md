This is DeckedOut:ResetV1.02 a updated version of TangoTeks original decked out map.

With Deckedout2 running on the season 9 hermitcraft server I figured now was a good time to update the old map and update a few features.

This map was originally shared by onemanonechance on reddit with credit to Vedekli for helping reduce lag. But the map hasnt been updated in 2 years, I opted to update it from 1.16 to 1.19 and to do a few fixes and upgrades to make it a bit more usable for friends on servers.

If you are deploying this to a server, there is the risk that all the compasses will need to be reset as the compasses can become de-linked to their loadstones during server setup.


Big new additions / updates since v1.0
- Redstone showcase
  - each of the mechanisms in the dungeon gas been rebuilt in a showcase region to show how they all work.
  - to see the showcase area, go down to the dungeon entrance turn right, to the item exchange, enter the doors on the right, and go all the way down the hall way.
 
- black market randomizer
  - the black market has been updated with a cactus random pulse generator. each shop in the market is able to be used without restocking but each slot is randomly locked so you have no way of knowing what will be available when you enter (they are indicated with lights to show when is is open or not) market status doesn't update until player completely leaves the market or resets the dungeon. 
 
- Puffer Player Detector (ppd)
  - ppd has been updated to use gold pressure plates as the stone pressure plates were causing clank spam in 1.19
 
- resistance beacon re-enabled
  - the resistance beacon had become blocked during hermitcraft season 7 and was still blocked in the v1.0 reset release.

- compass dispenser update
  - in v1.0 the compasses were in a queue of hopper but this would cause the same 14 to cycle through, but the other 20 would never get pulled, now uses droppers so all compasses get cycled over time.

- loot finder boxes
  - a couple chests were changed to work with the loot finder card to help encourage exploration and make it so more stashes are around that don't require restoking (new loot finder chests have a mix of items that can be found besides just tokens),
  - old loot finders are all token only.

- Mob Spawners
  - since mob spawn conditions changed the zombie and skeleton spawners were no longer working. To fix this the lighting in the gravyard and sentry towers were adjusted.
  - spawning works again but the graveyard is alot darker, and there is now tinted glass aroudn the sentry tower.
 
Future Imrpovements
- water hazard
  - since vex are no longer effective at killing, several water hazards have been added near evoker sentries. the water hazards are only deployed when player reaches max clank.
  - I tried ti implement it for the current version, but it is inconsistant with triggering causing it to be on or off at the wrong time.
